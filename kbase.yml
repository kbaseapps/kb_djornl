module-name:
    kb_djornl

module-description:
    The RWRtools module enables Random Walk with Restart (RWR) on gene-to-gene multiplex networks from multiple lines of evidence. These include protein-protein interactions, metabolic reactions, transcription factor regulation, and gene co-expression. Descriptions of provided multiplexes can be found [here](https://github.com/kbaseapps/kb_djornl/blob/main/NETWORKS.md). RWRtools LOE (Lines of Evidence) performs RWR from one geneset to see how many of another geneset are highly ranked. RWRtools CV (Cross Validation) performs RWR Cross Validation on a single gene set to find the RWR rank of the left-out genes.
