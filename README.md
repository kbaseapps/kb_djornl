# kb_djornl

[![Build Status][build-image]][build-url]

This [KBase](https://kbase.us) module is a wrapper and visualization for RWR
tools which use the random walk with restart method on multiplex coexpression
networks representing genes (nodes) and distinct lines of evidence (edges)
facilitating the rapid determination of the functional context of genes of
interest. This generated by the [KBase Software Development Kit (SDK)][kb-sdk].

You will need to have the SDK installed to use this module. [Learn more about
the SDK and how to use it][kb-sdk-docs].

You can also learn more about the apps implemented in this module from its
[catalog page][kb_djornl-catalog] or its [spec file](kb_djornl.spec).

### RWRtoolkit CV

This app wraps the RWR Cross Validation tool which performs k-fold cross
validation on a single gene set, finding the RWR rank of the left-out genes.
One can choose either leave-one-out to leave only one gene from the gene set
out and find its rank, or run k-fold cross-validation for a specified value
of k.

### RWRtoolkit LOE

This app wraps the RWR Lines of Evidence tool which has two possible functions.
Given one geneset of seeds, rankings for all other genes in the network will
be returned.  Given a second geneset, ranking for just the genes in that geneset
will be returned.  This can be used to build multiple lines of evidence from
the various input networks to relate the two gene sets.

# Tests

Run
```bash
kb-sdk test
```

Add your KBase developer token to `test_local/test.cfg` and run:

```bash
kb-sdk test
```

This may take a long time, the build action is runs in approximately 30 minutes
from scratch. Subsequent runs should be faster for two reasons. Firstly, the
initial Docker build takes some time, primarily compiling the conda
environment. This needs to be done only once since Docker will cache the
results. Secondly, the `exascale_repo` data source is validated and this can
take around 10 minutes on its own. Since this is loaded as refdata, this also
only happens when the refdata is updated. For instructions on how to update the
refdata, see the [Howsto](#howsto) section below.

# Contributing

Note: By default the module image uses Python 3.8.10, and these instructions are
tested with this version, but will probably work with any higher version.
Follow the following instructions to configure your development environment.

0. Install prerequisites:
    - kb-sdk
    - node >= 20.9.0
    - python >= 3.8.10
1. Make a virtual environment and activate it.
```
python -m venv $VENV
source $VENV/bin/activate
```
2. Install Python requirements:
```
pip install \
    --extra-index-url https://pypi.anaconda.org/kbase/simple \
    -r requirements.txt
```
2. Run `kb-sdk test`. This will generate a sample report.
3. Install the Javascript requirements:
```
npm install
```
4. Start a server to serve the sample report:
```
npm run serve
```
By default this server listens on port 8080, but you can specify any port with
the following invocation:
```
npm run serve -- --port $PORT
```
5. (Optional) Enable the pre-commit hooks:
```
cp scripts/pre-commit.sh .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

# Howsto

The instructions in this section refer to the following external repositories:
- Data: [`exascale_data`][repo-exascale]
- Relation Engine (RE): [`relation_engine`][repo-re]
- The [`RWRtoolkit`][repo-rwrtoolkit] repository.

## Test a new version of the app

1. Register the app in the desired environment.
2. Update app cells in narratives with the new version of the app.
3. Create an app cell representing a call guaranteed to contain some of the new
    data to confirm that it has been updated correctly.

## Update layer

This section specifically refers how to add, edit or replace edges in an
    existing network.
1. Update the `exascale_data` repo with the layer in question, this should
    ultimately be an update to a single file in the `prerelease/edge_data`
    folder.
2. Commit this change to the repository in GitHub.
3. Modify the `git clone` command for `exascale_data` in
    `scripts/refdata-load.sh` to point to the correct branch or commit.
4. Bump the `data-version` semantic version value in `kbase.yml`. This will
    ensure that the refdata is loaded in the next step.
5. Commit these changes to the `kb_djornl` repository in GitHub.
6. Test this new version of the app.

## Add Layer

This section specifically refers how to add a single new network represented by
a TSV file with four columns (`node1`, `node2`, `score`, `edge_type`) and a
header row. It also assumes that this network introduces a single new
`edge_type`.

1. Update the `exascale_data` repo.
    1. Add the layer in question, this should ultimately be an addition of a
        single file to the `prerelease/edge_data` folder.
    2. Update the `prerelease/manifest.yaml` file with appropriate metadata for
        this layer.
    3. Commit these changes to the repository in GitHub.
2. Update the RE repo.
    1. Modify the `spec/datasets/djornl/edge_type.yaml` file ensuring that the
        `const` key's value matches the edge type in the network (edge) file.
    2. Commit these changes to the repository in GitHub.
3. Update the `kb_djornl` app:
    1. Modify `edgeMetadata` in the `report/app/style.js` file. The key should
        be the desired `edge_type` and the value should contain the other
        appropriate metadata.
    2. Modify the `git clone` command for `exascale_data` and `relation_engine`
        in `scripts/refdata-load.sh` to point to the correct branch or commit
        for the changes above.
    3. Bump the `data-version` semantic version value in `kbase.yml`. This
        will ensure that the refdata is loaded in the next step.
    4. Commit these changes to the repository in GitHub.
4. Test this new version of the app.

## View a sample report generated by the tests

1. Ensure that the test that generates the report runs last in the test suite.
    You may prefer to skip all other tests so that the test of interest is the
    only one that runs.
2. Run the postinstall script: `npm run postinstall`. This will automatically
    run the `kb-sdk test` command and download the static files required to
    make the report appear as it would in KBase.
3. If you have not yet already, run `npm run serve` and load the sample report:
    `http://localhost:8080`.
4. Update `metadata.json`. You need to set `objid` to the obect id of the
    workspace object holding the visual app state.
5. Add the workspace id to `localStorage`. In the javascript console run:
    `localStorage.setItem("wsid", mywsid)` where mywsid is the numeric
    workspace id of the workspace object holding the visual app state.
6. Set a browser cookie for the `localhost` hostname named `kbase_session`
    whose value should be a valid authentication token for your chosen KBase
    environment. You can reuse the token from `test.cfg`.
7. Disable CORS for localhost. This must be done since the app is not
    configured to use a KBase service proxy answering on localhost.
8. Reload the report. It should now be fully functional.
