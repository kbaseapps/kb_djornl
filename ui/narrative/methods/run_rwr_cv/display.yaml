name: Find Gene Set Interconnectivity using Cross Validation with RWRtools CV

tooltip: |
    RWRtools CV (Cross Validation) performs cross validation on a single gene
        set, finding the RWR rank of the left-out genes.

parameters :
    seeds_feature_set :
        ui-name : |
            Seed Gene Keys
        short-hint : |
            Feature set of A. thaliana seed genes of interest.
    multiplex:
        ui-name : |
            Multiplex
        short-hint : |
            Choose a pre-built multiplex network based on types of experimental
                evidence you would like incorporated in your analysis.  
                Descriptions of multiplexes can be found by following the link 
                in the app description. 
                Default is the Comprehensive Network (9 network layers).
    node_rank_max:
        ui-name : |
            Maximum node rank
        short-hint : |
            Include the top ranked nodes up to this maximum (default = 10).
    output_name:
        ui-name: |
            Output Feature Set Name
        short-hint : |
            The name to give the workspace object representing the highest
                ranked genes.
    description:
        ui-name: |
            Description
        short-hint: |
            A short description of the interpretation of the output genes.
    method:
        ui-name : |
            Method
        short-hint : |
            Cross-validation method. Methods include k-fold (default method with 5 folds),
            leave-one-out (loo) (leave only one gene from the gene set out and use 
            other genes to find its rank), or singletons (where one gene is used to 
            find the ranks of all other genes in the gene set).
    folds:
        ui-name : |
            Number of folds
        short-hint : |
            Number (k) of folds to use in k-fold CV (default = 5).
    restart:
        ui-name : |
            Restart probability
        short-hint : |
            Higher values means the walker will jump back to a seed node more
            often (default = 0.7).
    tau:
        ui-name : |
            Tau
        short-hint : |
            A comma-separated list of values that must add up to the number of
            network layers. One value per network layer that determines the
            probability that the random walker will restart in that layer (default 
            = 1 per layer).
