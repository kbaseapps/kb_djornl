    RWR Cross Validation performs K-fold cross validation on a single gene
        set, finding the RWR rank of the left-out genes. Can choose either
        leave-one-out to leave only one gene from the gene set out and
        find its rank, or k-fold cross-validation.

parameters :
    gene_keys :
        ui-name : |
            Seed Gene Keys
        short-hint : |
            Space separated Gene Keys
    input_feature_set :
        ui-name : |
            Input feature set
        short-hint : |
            Feature Set of A. thaliana seed genes
    multiplex:
        ui-name : |
            Multiplex
        short-hint : |
            Choose a pre-built multiplex network based on types of experimental
                evidence you would like incorporated in your analysis, such as
                protein-protein interactions, metabolic reactions, transcription
                factor regulation, and gene co-expression.
    node_rank_max:
        ui-name : |
            Maximum node rank
        short-hint : |
            Include the top ranked nodes up to this maximum
    output_name:
        ui-name: |
            Output Feature Set Name
        short-hint : |
            The name to give the workspace object representing the highest
                ranked genes.
    description:
        ui-name: |
            Description
        short-hint: |
            A short description of the interpretation of the outupt genes.
    method:
        ui-name : |
            Method
        short-hint : |
            Cross-validation method.
    folds:
        ui-name : |
            Number of folds
        short-hint : |
            Number (k) of folds to use in k-fold CV
    restart:
        ui-name : |
            Restart probability
        short-hint : |
            Higher values means the walker will jump back to a seed node more
            often.
    tau:
        ui-name : |
            Tau
        short-hint : |
            A comma-separated list of values that must add up to the number of
            network layers. One value per network layer that determines the
            probability that the random walker will restart in that layer.
