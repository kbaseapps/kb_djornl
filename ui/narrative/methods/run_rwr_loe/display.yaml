    RWR Lines of Evidence performs RWR from one geneset to see how many of
        another geneset are highly ranked. This can be used to build multiple
        lines of evidence from the various input networks to relate the two
        gene sets. This script will run RWR using the first geneset against the
        entire genome, but reports only the ranks from the second gene set.

parameters :
    gene_keys :
        ui-name : |
            Seed Gene Keys
        short-hint : |
            If no target gene keys are provided below then these seeds will be
            used in a context analysis
    gene_keys2 :
        ui-name : |
            Target Gene Keys
        short-hint : |
            Space separated Gene Keys
    multiplex:
        ui-name : |
            Multiplex
        short-hint : |
            Choose a pre-built multiplex network based on types of experimental
                evidence you would like incorporated in your analysis, such as
                protein-protein interactions, metabolic reactions, transcription
                factor regulation, and gene co-expression.
    node_rank_max:
        ui-name : |
            Maximum node rank
        short-hint : |
            Include the top ranked nodes up to this maximum
    restart:
        ui-name : |
            Restart probability
        short-hint : |
            Higher values means the walker will jump back to a seed node more
            often.
    tau:
        ui-name : |
            Tau
        short-hint : |
            A comma-separated list of values that must add up to the number of
            network layers. One value per network layer that determines the
            probability that the random walker will restart in that layer.
