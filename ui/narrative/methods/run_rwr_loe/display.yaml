parameters :
    seeds_feature_set:
        ui-name : |
            Seed Gene Keys
        short-hint : |
            Feature Set of A. thaliana target genes. If no target gene keys are
            provided below then these seeds will be used in a context analysis.
    targets_feature_set:
        ui-name : |
            Target Gene Keys
        short-hint : |
            Feature Set of A. thaliana target genes
    multiplex:
        ui-name : |
            Multiplex
        short-hint : |
            Choose a pre-built multiplex network based on types of experimental
                evidence you would like incorporated in your analysis.  
                Descriptions of multiplexes are located
                <a href="https://github.com/kbaseapps/kb_djornl/blob/main/NETWORKS.md">"here"</a>.
                Default is the Comprehensive Network (9 network layers).
    node_rank_max:
        ui-name : |
            Maximum node rank
        short-hint : |
            Include the top ranked nodes up to this maximum (default = 10).
    output_name:
        ui-name: |
            Output Feature Set Name
        short-hint : |
            The name to give the workspace object representing the highest
                ranked genes.
    description:
        ui-name: |
            Description
        short-hint: |
            A short description of the interpretation of the output genes.
    restart:
        ui-name : |
            Restart probability
        short-hint : |
            Higher values means the walker will jump back to a seed node more
            often (default = 0.7).
    tau:
        ui-name : |
            Tau
        short-hint : |
            A comma-separated list of values that must add up to the number of
            network layers. One value per network layer that determines the
            probability that the random walker will restart in that layer (default
            = 1 per layer).

    <p><b>RWRtools LOE (Lines of Evidence)</b> performs Random Walk with Restart
        (RWR) from one geneset to rank other genes in the network using multiple 
        lines of biological evidence. This app has two possible functions. Given 
        one geneset of seeds, rankings for all other genes in the network will be 
        returned. Given a second geneset of genes to be queried, rankings for just 
        the genes in that geneset will be returned. This can be used to build 
        multiple lines of evidence from the various input networks to relate the 
        two gene sets.</p>
